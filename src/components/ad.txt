Hello


With the recent climate that we're in. 

Winter is starting to get colder & colder. Days getting shorter. 

We're entering in a looming recession only after years of Covid-19 and government lockdowns. 

Our mental health has definately taken a toll. Nearly two-thirds of people (65%) say that they have experienced a mental health problem.

I'd want to introduct PROJECT SHUT UP & LISTEN. 

Our aim is to combat the decline in mental health in a unique way.

Feeling lonely, stresed, anxious, overwhemled? 

Therapy too complicated, pretentious, expensive? 

Just NEED to be connected, appreciated, heard?

We're here.

Let's connect!
